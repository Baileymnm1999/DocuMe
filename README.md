# What is this?
This project was my first experience writing large amounts of code. Conducted the summer between my junior and senior years of high school. I haven't looked at this project in a very long time. The code is probably poorly structured, abysmally written, and might not even work anymore. I would not point to this project for anything other than to say, "Hey I was pushing myself to try cool stuff even in high school".

# About the project
DocuMe was intended to be an app that could be used to photo-document projects as you progress on them. The driving use case was working on cars. As I replace the timing belt on my truck, I am able to photograph and annotate each step along the way so that *if* and when I get to putting it back together, I may refer to may documentation to know what nuts and bolts go where.
